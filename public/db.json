The IRCC (Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada) has unveiled plans for a groundbreaking Express Entry draw, one that is focused exclusively on profiles with experience in agriculture and agri-food occupations. This move is not just a significant step in the right direction but could also lead to the lowest-ever Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) cutoff scores in a category-based draw.</p><p><strong>Addressing the Labour Shortage</strong></p><p>Canada's agriculture and agri-food sector has been grappling with a persistent labour shortage, a challenge that has taken center stage in recent times. With an aging workforce and increased demand for food production, it has become imperative to attract skilled professionals who can contribute to the sector's growth and sustainability. This Express Entry draw is a direct response to this pressing need.</p><p><strong>A Historic Turn of Events</strong><p><p>As anticipation mounts, experts in the field of Canadian immigration are making bold predictions. Given the specialized nature of this draw, with a focus on just three eligible occupations within agriculture and agri-food, it is highly likely that the CRS cutoff scores will plummet to unprecedented levels. This means that candidates with relatively lower CRS scores may find themselves receiving coveted Invitations to Apply (ITAs).</p><p><strong>What Makes this Draw Special</strong></p><p>To be eligible for this unique Express Entry round of invitations, candidates must possess a minimum of 6 months of experience in one of the specified occupations within the agriculture and agri-food industry. The government's commitment to attracting top talent in these roles is evident, and this draw is a testament to that dedication.</p><p>For those within the agriculture and agri-food sector, this is a momentous opportunity. The chance to contribute to Canada's vibrant farming and food processing industries while enjoying the country's renowned quality of life is now closer than ever. Whether you're a retail or wholesale butcher, a farm supervisor, or an agricultural service contractor, your skills and expertise are in high demand.</p><p>As we look ahead to the upcoming Agriculture and Agri-Food Express Entry draw, the future appears promising. The labour shortage in this sector is being addressed head-on, and skilled professionals can soon make their mark in Canada's thriving agriculture industry.</p><p>Stay tuned for further updates as the draw unfolds.</p>",

The country's population increased by over a million people from July 2022 to July 2023, representing a remarkable 3% rise. Additionally, there was a substantial 46% surge in the number of temporary residents in Canada during the same period.</p><p>The Liberal government has consistently set record-breaking immigration targets in recent years but has not established specific limits on temporary visa holders. As a result, the estimated number of temporary residents in Canada now surpasses the Indigenous population counted in the 2021 census.<p>The increase in temporary residents was primarily driven by individuals with work visas, with international students playing a lesser role in this growth.</p>This population boom driven by immigration is significant for immigrants and those aspiring to immigrate to Canada. It indicates the country's openness to welcoming newcomers, which can lead to various opportunities for economic, cultural, and social advancement. The surge in temporary residents, particularly those with work visas, suggests a growing demand for skilled labour and underscores Canada's commitment to attracting talent from around the world. Overall, this trend bodes well for individuals seeking to make Canada their home or explore temporary opportunities within the country.</p>",

This significant shift in policy opens up new opportunities for individuals looking to settle in Ontario, Canada, particularly those with a background in healthcare. Targeted notifications of interest were sent out to potential candidates who met the specified CRS score criteria and possessed work experience in select health-related occupations.</p><p>On September 26th 2023, invitations were exclusively extended to candidates with work experience in specific National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes. To qualify for this stream, your primary NOC in your Express Entry profile must fall under one of the following categories:</p><p>NOC - 31102 - General practitioners and family physicians</p><p>NOC 31300 - Nursing coordinators and supervisors</p><p>NOC 31300 - Nursing coordinators and supervisors</p><p>NOC 31301 - Registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses</p><p>NOC 32101 - Licensed practical nurses</p><p>NOC 33102 - Nurse aides, orderlies, and patient service associates</p><p>This brings a ray of hope for wishful immigrants who have the dream of living in Ontario.

            "body": "<p>As of September 26, 2023, the latest Express Entry draw brought some exciting news for hopeful immigrants. The CRS cut-off score, which determines who receives an Invitation to Apply for permanent residence, has seen a drop, standing at 504 points. This marks a 27-point decrease from the previous draw on September 19, which had a minimum CRS score of 531. While the number of invitations issued this time may be slightly lower, this development is still generating buzz. Let's dive into what's happening!</p><p>Looking back at the journey through the pandemic and the challenges posed by the coronavirus outbreak, it's evident that Canada has been on a remarkable downward trend in terms of minimum CRS scores since 2022. Many experts and observers anticipated this trend to continue throughout 2023. Notably, unprecedented global events like the COVID-19 pandemic compelled Canada to conduct draws with lower CRS scores to facilitate the arrival of skilled workers and international students, thereby contributing to economic recovery. Additionally, there appears to be a growing demand for specific skills and occupations, prompting the government to lower CRS requirements to attract candidates with these tailored qualifications to bolster the job market and economy.</p><p>However, predicting whether this trend will persist or shift is as challenging as ever, given the multifaceted factors at play. It's a complex dance involving the Canadian economy's uncertainties, evolving immigration policies, and the ever-changing global economic landscape, influenced by both foreseen and unforeseen events.</p><p>Taking a closer look at this year's Express Entry draws across all programs, the CRS scores have been a dynamic spectacle, fluctuating between 481 and 531. There have been moments of decline followed by upward swings, with no definitive trend emerging from the scores' behavior.</p><p>One intriguing aspect that may contribute to these fluctuations is the time of year, with a special nod to the upcoming months of October, November, and December. Although not directly correlated to holiday months, but rather what the Canadian government decides to do, there is a possibility that within the next few months, Canada's economic needs can fluctuate seasonally. Certain industries or regions may require more skilled workers during these specific times of the year. So, to meet these needs, the government may decrease the CRS score requirements.</p><p>As we approach the year's end, with major holidays on the horizon and potential shifts in the Canadian economy, we could be in for a continued downward trend in the minimum CRS score. This would align with the aim of meeting labour market demands, fostering economic growth, and bridging labour gaps in certain industries as we head into the final stretch of 2023. Exciting times for those looking to make Canada their new home!</p>",

Going back to the very beginning of the process, after ensuring that you are eligible for the program, you will be checking your score using a CRS (Comprehensive Ranking System) tool. It assesses you on the basis of your skills, education, language ability, work experience, and more. You would then gather your documents regarding the aforementioned assessments and fill out your profile. Candidates with the highest score will be sent an invitation to apply, where you will have 60 days to submit your application.</p><p>Simple, right?</p><p>Express Entry is your go-to immigration program if you’re looking for one that is fast and efficient in its processing times, working on the basis of a scoring system.

These international students have the opportunity to obtain a Post-Graduate Work Permit to help them kick start their professional life in Canada. In this blog, we’ll explore the benefits, eligibility criteria, and application process for PGWP programs in Canada. If you’re a recent graduate from a DLI in Canada, you may want to pay attention.</p><p><strong>What is a PGWP Program?</strong></p><p>A PGWP is a permit that allows students who graduated from eligible Canadian designated learning institutions (DLIs) to obtain an open work permit. With this permit, it allows them to gain valuable Canadian work experience, and when it is gained through the PGWP Program, graduates are able to qualify for permanent residency in Canada through Express Entry. </p><p>[Express entry is an application process for skilled immigrants who want to settle in Canada permanently and take part in the economy. A designated learning institution (DLI) is a school approved by a provincial or territorial government to host international students.]</p><p>Now, “experience” is quite a broad term and does not specify what exactly can be classified as relevant experience. This is why we categorize experience in Training, Education, Experience, and Responsibilities (i.e., TEER), within categories 0, 1, 2, or 3.</p><p>These permits are also exempt from LMIAs, which, as stated in a previous blog, is a document that employers in Canada may need to get before hiring a foreign worker. With a PGWP, graduates can work full-time, part-time, or be self-employed.</p><p><strong>Application Process</strong></p><p>The first step in the application process is ensuring that you apply within 180 days of obtaining written confirmation. The application package is obtained through the IRCC website, within and outside of Canada. Two confirming documents that are required are, of course, the letter confirming the completion of study, as well as the transcript.</p><p><strong>Things to Consider</strong></p><p>There are a few things to take note of before looking to apply for a PGWP. This can include whether or not you graduated from a designated learning institution (DLI), if you completed school via distance learning, or other factors that would make you ineligible for a PGWP.</p><p><strong>Why Choose PGWP?</strong></p><p>Picture a PGWP as your gateway to the working world, transitioning from and bridging the gap between being an international student to a working employee. This open work permit not only allows for flexibility, but also allows you to gain highly valued Canadian work experience. But, the journey does not stop there: having a PGWP helps you transition into the next stage of your career and creates a pathway to permanent residency.

            "published_date": "Dec 5, 2022",
            "body": "<p><strong>Refusal of a Canada visa is the biggest obstacle for individuals who want to study, work, and settle in Canada. Numerous applicants seeking entry to Canada are denied visas each year. There are different reasons your Canadian visa application could be denied.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>So without further ado, let's look at the top five reasons why Canada denies visa applications.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1. FAILURE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS When applying for a Canadian visa, applicants will be required to submit supporting documents demonstrating that they have not provided false information. Students applying for a study permit, for instance, are required to submit a copy of their degree and transcripts. Professionals, on the other hand, must submit a reference letter detailing their work experience, hours worked, and responsibilities when applying for a work visa to Canada. Your visa could be denied if you don't provide enough evidence to back up your claims.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>2. INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE YOU CAN SUPPORT YOURSELF FINANCIALLY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Whether you are going to Canada for studying, working, or traveling, you will need to provide sufficient proof that you will not be a liability to Canada. You will be required to demonstrate your ability to support yourself and any accompanying family members during your stay in Canada. Your Canadian visa application may be denied if you are unable to provide the necessary documentation to support your claim. Every international student applying for a study visa to Canada must demonstrate their financial stability. They can achieve this by offering: If they have transferred money to Canada, evidence of a Canadian bank account in their name, a student or education loan from a bank, a Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) from a participating Canadian financial institution, and proof that they have paid tuition and housing fees. Students applying for a student visa to Canada can check here how much they need to live on.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>3. Inability to demonstrate your intention to return to your home country&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>When applying for a tourist visa or student visa, applicants must keep in mind that the visa is only temporary and has an expiration date. As a result, applicants are required to provide sufficient evidence of their intention to return to their home nation. They will not remain in Canada after their visa expires if they provide evidence. A visa official might dismiss your application on the off chance that he is unconvinced that you will get back to your country toward your approved stay's end. You can provide certified translations of lease agreements for your property to demonstrate your intention to return to your home nation. Let's say you're a worker traveling to Canada as a tourist. If that's the case, you can provide an employment letter stating that you are a permanent employee of the company. You can also provide documentation stating the anticipated return date to your employment.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>4. Lack of evidence indicating good health:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;Applicants who intend to stay in Canada for at least six months are required to undergo a medical examination. A medical exam may or may not be required for those who stay for less than six months. It depends on what they intend to accomplish. The purpose of these medical examinations is to ensure that the applicant: Does not have an infectious disease that is currently active, such as syphilis or tuberculosis, which can pose a threat to public health. Do not experience a loss of physical and mental abilities, unpredictability, or violent behavior, which can pose a threat to public safety. If the applicant is unable to pass the medical exam and demonstrate that he is in good health, his visa may be denied.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>5. Moving on to the next reason why a visa was denied, the visa officer was not convinced that you intended to visit Canada. It stems from the applicant's inability to demonstrate to visa officers that he intends to travel to Canada. Immigration authorities require confirmation that your travel plans to Canada are legal and constructive. You'll need to show that you won't stay too long and are only visiting for tourism like to attend a conference or meet your family. Let's say the visa officer doesn't like your reason for going to Canada. He might deny your visa application to Canada in that case. Your previous travel experiences, such as overstaying in another country, may also have an impact on his decision.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conclusion: Rejecting a visa can discourage applicants and make it more difficult to apply for another visa in Canada. These are the top five reasons for Canada visa refusal, though there are many other possible explanations. Therefore, the takeaway is to keep them in mind when you apply for your visa at the following time. If you want to reapply for a visa, you can get assistance from our skilled immigration consultant to avoid any problems with the application process.</strong></p>",

All you need is to be eligible for one of the 3 immigration programs that use Express Entry; Canadian Experience Class, Federal Skilled Worker, and Federal Skilled Trades (FST). However, since Express Entry is a points-based system, a higher CRS score means a higher chance of immigrating to Canada.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>It’s used to assess your:</strong></p><p><br></p><ol><li><p><strong>skills</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>education</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>language ability</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>work experience</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>other factors</strong></p></li></ol><p><br></p><p><strong>Since the start of all-program draws on July 6th, the CRS score has been steadily declining, as we have observed with prior Express Entry draws. Since every program attracts applications, 7,500 applicants have received ITAs; this number is anticipated to rise.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Each draw has seen an increase in the number of candidates invited, although the CRS cut-off score has continuously decreased as the backlog of applications in the system is being processed. A 9-point drop from 525 to 516 in the previous draw was seen in the most recent draw. In the 230th draw, ITAs were awarded to an extra 2,750 applicants.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The following draws are anticipated to see a further decline in the CRS score. Canada will start accepting candidates based on merit starting in the first quarter of 2023.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The immigration minister will be able to invite candidates based on groupings rather than just CRS ratings under Bill C-19, which was unveiled earlier this year. Combinations of work experience in a sought-after occupation or set of occupations, linguistic ability, and educational background may be grouped together. The CRS cut-off is expected to be substantially lower compared to the general draws that we have been witnessing lately because candidates will be judged against those in their group rather than the whole Express Entry pool.</strong></p>",

By the middle of early 2022, we can anticipate that IRCC will start implementing this change. The National Occupational Classification (NOC) system undergoes major structural revisions every ten years, which is why this change is taking place. As a result of this change, information from numerous relevant stakeholders and the existing occupational groups is examined.</strong></p><p><strong>Statistics Canada, the IRCC, and job seekers (both domestic and international) would be the primary stakeholders in this change. The TEER classification, or updated system, was developed in response to Canada's current economic climate.</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>The NOC is Canada's public word-related reference. It classifies employment activities in Canada to help understand how the Canadian labor market is structured, run government programs, encourage skill development, conduct research, and help Canada manage its immigration and foreign worker programs.</strong></p><p><strong>Every ten years, the federal government conducts a comprehensive review of the NOC. Consequently, the NOC is updated to reflect the Canadian labor market and economic changes. Statistics Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) launched NOC 2021 in September.NOC 2021 is the climax of an extensive interaction that incorporates a thorough review, investigation, and assessment of the Canadian economy.</strong></p><p><strong>Currently, NOC 2016 is used by Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), and Canada's provinces and territories to manage immigration and foreign worker programs. However, IRCC stated that NOC 2021 will be implemented in the fall of 2022 by both IRCC and ESDC.
